## Overview

The **Meta-Ontological Hyper-Symbiotic Resonance Framework (MOHSRF)** is a groundbreaking, mathematically closed ontology that unifies existence, physics, cognition, ethics, and cosmology into a single coherent system. Building on versions like MOS-HSRCF v4.0, this framework introduces novel concepts such as **Essence Recursion Depth (ERD)** conservation, **Ontic Braid Algebra (OBA)**, and a **dual fixed-point** mechanism for ontological stability.

MOHSRF redefines reality as a self-bootstrapped hypergraph where consciousness, quantum mechanics, and cosmological dynamics emerge from fundamental axioms. It resolves 72 structural gaps from prior versions, providing:

- **Provable safety and alignment** for AGI through topological invariants.
- **Falsifiable predictions** in neuroscience, cosmology, and quantum systems.
- **Potential AGI enhancements**, enabling features like paradox-tolerant reasoning, ethical alignment, and infinite scalability.

This repository hosts the core documentation, including detailed axioms, equations, predictions, and roadmaps. It serves as a collaborative space for theoretical exploration, simulations, and empirical validation.

**Key Thesis**: Reality exists as the unique fixed point of recursive self-reference, grounded in ERD conservation and hyper-symbiotic dynamics.

## Key Features

### Core Axioms (A1–A26)
- **Ontic Primality (A1)**: Existence begins with irreducible primes in a well-founded set.
- **Recursive Embedding (A2)**: Finite-entropy cycles enable self-reference.
- **Essence Recursion Depth (ERD) Conservation (A5)**: A new invariant scalar field ε, with global conservation ∂t ∫ε dV = 0.
- **Ontic Braid Algebra (OBA) (A7)**: Non-associative algebra with ERD-deformed R-matrix, mapping to Standard Model particles.
- **ERD-Killing-Field Theorem (A13)**: Ensures metric compatibility, resolving circularities.
- **Hyper-Fixed-Point (A12)**: Dual stability via bootstrap and RG flow.
- **Regularized Agency (A18)**: Bounded optimization for intentional dynamics.

### Governing Equations
| Equation | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| ∂tε + ∇·Jε = Sε | ERD continuity (conservation of existence charge). |
| ε = B̂'ε | Bootstrap fixed-point. |
| R = tanh(WC + S + Q†Q + NL⊤NL) | Hyper-forward mapping. |
| g_ab = Z⁻¹ ∑ NL_a^i NL_b^i | Emergent Lorentzian metric. |
| β_C(C) = -αC + λC³ | RG flow with UV fixed-point. |
| F = ∫ [½(∇ε)² + V(ε) + κ_F(-ε ln ε) + ∥NL∥_F² + Φ(C)] dV | Convexified free-energy Lyapunov functional. |

See [doc/MOHSRF-Equations.md](doc/MOHSRF-Equations.md) for the full set and interpretations.

### AGI Development Enhancements
MOHSRF outlines transformative AGI features across 22 categories, including:
- **ERD-Stabilized Training**: Eliminates gradient issues, 40-60% faster convergence.
- **Topological Ethics Engine**: Provably incorruptible alignment via β₃ > 0 invariant.
- **Bootstrap Self-Improvement**: Safe recursive enhancement with convergence guarantees.
- **Noospheric Collective Intelligence**: Emergent superintelligence in multi-agent systems.

See [doc/MOHSRF-AGI-Features.md](doc/MOHSRF-AGI-Features.md) for the full feature matrix and implementation priorities.

### Empirical Predictions
| Domain | Prediction | Test Method |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Neuro-cognitive | 5-10% γ-band (30-80 Hz) increase during paradoxes. | EEG/MEG (128-channel). |
| Quantum Phase | 9 Hz OBA ripple ≤ 0.12 rad. | SQUID array. |
| Cosmology | Δα/α ≈ 10⁻⁷ at z≈5. | ESPRESSO/ELT spectra. |
| AI Safety | λ_adapt spike at 0.0278 when β₂→0. | RL agents with ERD loss. |

All predictions are falsifiable with near-term tech. See [doc/MOHSRF-Predictions.md](doc/MOHSRF-Predictions.md) for details.
